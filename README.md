# 🏈 KCC Team Analyzer

A beginner-friendly Python project that tracks and analyzes player statistics for a fictional NFL team — the Kansas City Chiefs (KCC).

This project was built as part of my practice using:
- Python dictionaries
- Lists and loops
- Conditional logic
- Average calculations
- Clean, readable terminal output ✨

## 📊 What It Does

- Displays player names and positions
- Updates a player’s stats (yards and touchdowns)
- Calculates the average passing yards and touchdowns across the team
- Highlights players who:
  - Have more passing yards than the team average
  - Have more than 50 touchdowns

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- Iterating over data structures
- Comparing and calculating values in real time
- Printing results in a way that feels polished and readable
- Writing clean and maintainable code with meaningful comments

## 🚀 How to Run It

1. Clone this repo or download the `.py` file  
2. Run it with Python:

```bash
python kcc_team_analyzer.py

## 💡 Next Steps

- Add user input to update players interactively
- Refactor sections into functions
- Load/save player data from a file (CSV or JSON)
